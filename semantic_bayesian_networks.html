          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Portfolio management is a complex decision-making process that aims
            to maximise return through the proportional allocation of investable
            capital into identified financial securities. The initial share
            evaluation phase involves identifying securities with suitable
            characteristics for inclusion in a portfolio. Portfolio selection is
            the successive phase of portfolio management and determines the
            optimal allocation of the set of identified shares in a portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stock market is a dynamic, non-linear and chaotic system. This
            requires investment professionals to assess and evaluate multiple
            factors, including contradictory information when deciding whether a
            share is suitable for inclusion in an investment portfolio.
            Intelligent systems incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI)
            techniques to automate tasks and support human decision-making.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <em>INVEST</em> system, proposed by Drake, is one such
            intelligent system that incorporates ontologies and Bayesian
            networks to support decision-making for share evaluation on the
            Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). Ontologies are used to formally
            encode unstructured expert information into a representative,
            machine-understandable form, whilst Bayesian networks (BNs) are
            useful in the financial domain as it represents uncertain, ambiguous
            or incomplete knowledge.
          </p>
          <h3>Research Objectives</h3>
          In this research, we evaluated the
          <em>INVEST</em> system with varying conditions and test several system
          extensions.
          <ol>
            <li>
              Evaluate the base
              <em>INVEST</em> system as designed by Drake.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conduct an ablation study to assess the relative importance of
              each component in the overall framework.
            </li>
            <li>
              Extend the system to include systematic risk within the BN
              topology.
            </li>
            <li>
              Test the stability and robustness of the
              <em>INVEST</em> system through a noise simulation component.
            </li>
            <li>
              Integrate a deep learning predictive component into the
              <em>INVEST</em> system.

            <br />
            The system is composed of six submodules within the
            <em>INVEST</em> module. The <em>INVEST</em> module contains a
            <code>Store</code> class, which represents the central point of the
            system. Responsibilities include invoking the functionality of the 6
            submodules and running different experiments dependent on user
            input. The package diagram on the left depicts the dependencies
            between modules and submodules.

                    This submodule contains data loading and preprocessing
                    utilities. Furthermore, this component has been extended to
                    include a noise simulation component to facilitate system

                  <p>
                    This submodule performs the financial calculations of the
                    system for each company, using financial ratios computation
                    and thresholding logic. Financial ratios produce a numerical
                    output, which the threshold component subsequently converts
                    to discrete states required as input for the BNs.

                    Recommendation. These BNs conduct inference using the
                    evidence returned by the thresholding component.

                    The <em>INVEST</em> system is evaluated through back-testing
                    using historical data for shares listed on the JSE. This
                    submodule contains the validation procedures and depends on
                    a Metrics submodule that houses risk and risk-adjusted
                    return metrics.

              The Value Evaluation network is used to evaluate a share relative
              to price and determines whether a share is <em>Cheap</em>,
              <em>FairValue</em> or <em>Expensive</em>. The Quality Evaluation
              network is used to evaluate the quality of a share and determines
              whether a share is of a <em>Low</em>, <em>Medium</em> or
              <em>High</em> quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, the Investment Recommendation network incorporates the
              output of the Quality and Value BNs to reflect the decision
              process performed by investors: evaluating whether the price of a
              share is reasonable and the quality of the share, thus providing
              an investment recommendation for a specific share. This network
              produces a final <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em> decision pertaining
              to system's assessment of the share's suitability for investment.

          <h2>Experimental Design</h2>
          <h3>Data</h3>
          <p>
            The dataset used consists of price and fundamental data for 36
            shares listed on the JSE between 2012 - 2018: 17 shares from the
            General Industrials sector and 19 shares from the Consumer Services
            sector.
          </p>
          <h3>Benchmark</h3>
          <p>
            The JSE All-Share Index, General Industrials (JGIND) and Consumer
            Services (JCSEV) are the selected benchmark indices to validate the
            share evaluation recommendations for the respective sectors. The
            benchmark dataset includes a composite of FTSE/JSE General
            Industrials, FTSE/JSE Consumer Services and FTSE/JSE All-Share
            indices data.
          </p>
          <h3>Setup</h3>
          <p>
            Each experiment is conducted on an Apple MacBook Pro with an
            Intel&reg; Core&trade; i5 CPU @ 2.4 GHz. Each experiment was run
            with the default threshold = 0.1 and a &beta; = 0.2 if not specified
            otherwise.
          </p>
          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <p>
            Return and Risk-Adjusted Return metrics are used to evaluate the
            performance of the semantic BNs for share evaluation. These metrics
            include Annual Return, Compound Return, Average Annual Return,
            Treynor Ratio and Sharpe Ratio. This selection is informed by our
            requirements of reproducibility and to support robust evaluation of
            other BN topologies. The system is evaluated over one-year and
            one-month holding periods.

            </span>
            For &beta; = 0.2, the experimental results demonstrate that the
            annual returns significantly outperformed the General Industrials
            benchmark in 2016 and the Consumer Services benchmark in 2015 and
            2016 respectively. This experiment was also run for &beta; = 0.6 and
            &beta; = 1, where it performed slightly worse providing tentative
            evidence towards a more conservative investment approach where the
            share has less systematic risk than the market. However, we note
            that it was still able to outperform the benchmark in the majority
            of the conducted experiments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on our empirical evaluation of INVEST, we conclude that the
            base INVEST system demonstrates consistent excess returns for the
            majority of the General Industrials and Consumer services sector
            with lower &beta; values, providing evidence for a more conservative
            investment approach.

          <h3>Extended <em>INVEST</em></h3>

            The extended Quality Bayesian Network depicts the systematic risk
            extension (modelled in pink), which was included by modifying the
            topology of the Quality Evaluation BN to model risk within the
            system. This experiment was conducted for &beta; = {0.2, 1.0} for
            years 2015 to 2018, and was compared to the base INVEST system.
          </p>

            >

            For &beta; = 0.2, we note that the extended system outperformed the
            baseline results for General Industrials, however, this was not the
            case for Consumer Services. For &beta; = 1, performance degraded for
            General Industrials, however, near parity was achieved relative to

            With the inclusion of systematic risk in the quality network, we
            note that with a lower &beta; value the system produced improved
            results. However, as &beta; increased to 1, it had a marginal impact
            on performance.
            <br />
            We conclude that there is tentative evidence to include systematic
            risk in the network.

            This experiment yielded unexpected results for &beta; = 0.2 .
            Considering only the Value BN, we observe that the resultant
            investment portfolio outperformed the INVEST baseline results across
            all metrics for Consumer Services, and over all metrics for General
            Industrials excluding AAR. We observe a significant decrease in
            performance when &beta; = 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Excluding the Value BN and testing only the Quality BN for &beta; =
            {0.2, 1.0} resulted in a stark decrease in performance . In both
            configurations, the base INVEST system outperformed the recommended
            investment portfolio.
            <br />
            We can conclude that the Value network is a relatively important
            component of the INVEST system in comparison to the Quality network.

            A hybrid experiment was performed by integrating a graph neural
            network model into the system. To perform the hybrid experiment, the
            FutureSharePerformance node was classified as <em>Positive</em>,
            <em>Negative</em> or <em>Stagnant</em> using inference on price
            movement from the GNN. The experiment was conducted for &beta; =
            {0.2, 1} for one-year and one-month holding periods and compared to
            the base INVEST system results.

            For &beta; = 0.2 for both holding periods, the same results were
            obtained given that an identical set of shares were selected.
            However, when &beta; = 1 for a one-year holding period , the results
            demonstrate no performance improvement for Consumer Services in
            comparison to the base system results. We note that for the General
            Industrials sector, the hybrid system outperforms the baseline
            results measured across all metrics.
          </p>
          <p>
            We posit that the results are a consequence of the specified
            prediction window. The GNN model outputs predicted values for the
            next 10 days, while the investment portfolio holding period is one
            year. When &beta; = 1 for the one-month holding period, we see an
            improvement in performance . The results demonstrate a drastic
            improvement relative to the one-year holding period for General
            Industrials.
          </p>

          <p>
            We conclude that a GNN, or more broadly, Machine Learning model
            integration could be valuable for short-term holding periods, such
            that the period is temporally consistent with the prediction horizon
            of the model.

            For the addition of noise, a fractional sample of the dataset is
            randomly adjusted positively or negatively by the standard deviation
            of the variable of interest. This was run 10 times and the mean
            metric values are reported.
          </p>
          <p>
            The results demonstrate that the INVEST system cannot entirely
            withstand noise given that different results are produced in
            comparison to the baseline. Therefore, we conclude that the system
            is not entirely stable and robust.
