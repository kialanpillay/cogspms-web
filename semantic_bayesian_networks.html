          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Portfolio management is a complex decision-making process that aims
            to maximise return through the proportional allocation of investable
            capital into identified financial securities. The initial share
            evaluation phase involves identifying securities with suitable
            characteristics for inclusion in a portfolio. Portfolio selection is
            the successive phase of portfolio management and determines the
            optimal allocation of the set of identified shares in a portfolio.
            The stock market is a dynamic, non-linear and chaotic system. This
            requires investment professionals to assess and evaluate multiple
            factors, including contradictory information when deciding whether a
            share is suitable for inclusion in an investment portfolio.
            Intelligent systems incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI)
            techniques to automate tasks and support human decision-making.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <em>INVEST</em> system, proposed by Drake, is one such
            intelligence system that incorporates ontologies and Bayesian
            networks to support decision-making for share evaluation on the
            Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). Ontologies are used to formally
            encode unstructured expert information into a representative,
            machine-understandable form, whilst Bayesian networks (BNs) are
            useful in the financial domain as it represents uncertain, ambiguous
            or incomplete knowledge.
          </p>
          <h3> Aims</h3>
          <p>
            In this research, we will  empirically evaluate the
            <em>INVEST</em> system with varying conditions and test several
            system extensions. 
            <ol>
              <li>
                We will evaluate the base
                <em>INVEST</em> system as designed by Drake.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will
            conduct an ablation study to assess the relative importance of each
            component in the overall framework.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will extend the
            system to include systematic risk within the BN topology.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will test the stability and robustness of the
            <em>INVEST</em> system through a noise simulation component.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will integrate a deep learning predictive component into
                the <em>INVEST</em> system.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h2>System Design</h2>

            >
                 <br /> The system is composed of six submodules within the <em>INVEST</em>
            module. The <em>INVEST</em> module contains a <em>Store</em> class, which represents the central point of the system. Responsibilities include invoking the functionality of the 6 submodules and running different experiments dependent on user input.  The package diagram on the left depicts the dependencies
            between modules and submodules.

			<p> The Value Evaluation network is used to evaluate a share relative to price and determines whether a share is <em>Cheap</em>, <em>FairValue</em> or  <em>Expensive</em>. The Quality Evaluation network is used to evaluate the quality of a share and determines whether a share is of a <em>Low</em>, <em>Medium</em> or <em>High</em>  quality. Finally,  The Investment Recommendation network incorporates the output of the Quality and Value BNs to reflect the decision process performed by investors: evaluating whether the price of a share is reasonable and the quality of the share, thus providing an investment recommendation for a specific share. This network produces a final <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em> decision pertaining to system's assessment of the share's suitability for investment. </p>
		</section>
		<h2>Experimental Design</h2>
		<p>  <ul>
      <li>
        <em> Dataset: </em> The dataset used consists of price and fundamental data for 36 shares listed on the JSE between 2012 - 2018: 17 shares from the General Industrials sector and 19 shares from the Consumer Services sector.
      </li>
      <li> <em> Benchmark: </em> The JSE All-Share Index, General Industrials (JGIND) and Consumer Services (JCSEV) are the selected benchmark indices to validate the share evaluation recommendations for the respective sectors. The benchmark dataset includes FTSE/JSE General Industrials index data, FTSE/JSE Consumer Services index data, as well as the FTSE/JSE All Share index data.  </li>
      <li> <em>Evaluation: </em>Return and Risk-Adjusted Return metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the semantic BNs for share evaluation. These metrics include Annual Return , Compound Return , Average Annual Return, Treynor Ratio and  Sharpe Ratio. This selection is informed by our requirements of reproducibility \cite{drake2020invest} and to support robust evaluation of other BN topologies. The system is evaluated over one-year and one-month holding periods. </li>
      <li> <em>Setup: </em>Each experiment is conducted on an Apple MacBook Pro with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU @ 2.4 GHz. Each experiment was run with the default margin of safety (threshold) of 0.1 and a $\beta$ of 0.2 if not specified otherwise. </li>
  </ul>

          <h2>Implementation</h2>
		  <span class="image left"
              ><img src="images/console.png" alt="" /></span
            >Python, a general-purpose programming language is the selected
            development platform for the system. The <em>PyAgrum</em> library
            is used to create and manage Bayesian networks, given its ability to
            perform efficient computations. Furthermore, a visualization web
            console was developed using a <em>Flask</em> server and
            <em> React</em>. This provides the user an opportunity to select
            different experiments, and obtain a graphical view of the results in
            comparison to the relative benchmark.
