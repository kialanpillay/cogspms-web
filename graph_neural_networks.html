          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Graph neural networks are a class of deep neural network models that
            process graphically-encoded multivariate data. Spatial-temporal
            graph neural networks process data exhibiting both spatial and
            temporal dependencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            A stock market is a financial market that facilitates the exchange
            of ownership shares of listed financial securities. Stock markets
            are dynamic systems that exhibit linear and non-linear dependencies.
            A correlation matrix provides a mechanism for encoding multivariate
            linear correlations in a graphical structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The literature has demonstrated ST-GNN applications to traffic
            network, energy and medical datasets, but there is a deficit of
            price prediction studies. Furthermore, existing research assumes
            prior knowledge of the graph structure and earlier techniques
            require predefined structure, an unsuitable prerequisite for stock
            market prediction with latent dependencies.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Previously introduced spatial-temporal GNNs are not suitable for
            modelling multivariate time series due to two distinct factors:
            unavailability of prior information and the sub-optimality of the
            predefined graph - Wu et al. (2020)
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Methodology</h2>
          <h3>Models</h3>
          <p>
            We evaluated Graph WaveNet (GWN), MTGNN and Spectral-Temporal Graph
            Neural Network (StemGNN) for stock market price prediction.
          </p>

            <div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
              <h4>Graph WaveNet</h4>
              <p>
                GWN is a hybrid architecture for spatial-temporal graph
                modelling. The architecture consists of temporal convolution
                (Gated TCN) and graph convolution (GCN) modules. The GCN module
                contains a self-adaptive adjacency matrix that requires no prior
                information and is learnt using stochastic gradient descent.
              </p>
              <p>
                The TCN module consists of one-dimensional convolutions that
                capture long-range temporal sequences. The GCN module extracts
                node-level dependencies using neighbourhood feature aggregation.
                We evaluated a double transition matrix plus adaptive adjacency
                matrix using the correlation matrix initialisation against the
                adaptive-only adjacency matrix.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
              <h4>MTGNN</h4>
              <p>
                MTGNN is a hybrid architecture designed with an explicit focus
                on multivariate time series forecasting. A graph learning layer
                extracts an adaptive adjacency matrix that requires no prior
                information. The TCN module captures temporal dependencies. The
                GCN module extracts node-level dependencies using neighbourhood
                feature aggregation.
              </p>
              <p>
                MTGNN is trained using a curriculum learning strategy that
                splits the input into subgroups. Curriculum learning locates
                optimal local minima by training the algorithm on a single-step
                forecasting task first and subsequently increasing the
                prediction horizon. We evaluated a predefined static graph
                structure against the adaptive-only adjacency matrix.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
              <h4>StemGNN</h4>
              <p>
                StemGNN is a hybrid architecture for multivariate time series
                forecasting that captures inter-series correlations and temporal
                dependencies in the spectral domain. StemGNN is trained on the
                spectral representation of the graph using graph signal
                processing techniques. The Spectral-GCN captures dependencies in
                the spectral domain.
              </p>
              <p>
                A graph signal is transformed into the spectral domain by a
                Fourier transform &#8497; and a convolution operator is applied
                to the spectral signal. A latent correlation layer automatically
                learns inter-series correlations to extract an adjacency matrix
                without prior information. For our evaluation, StemGNN was not
                initialised with the correlation matrix.

            We tested the performance of the ST-GNNs and baseline LSTM and Naive
            models on a single-step forecasting task for 30-, 60- and 120-day
            window sizes. Regular trading days for the Johannesburg Stock
            Exchange are Monday through Friday, and thus the selected window
            sizes correspond to 6, 12 and 24 trading weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The results show that <b>MTGNN</b> outperforms both GWN and StemGNN
            by a substantial margin for all tested input window sizes. The
            performance variation between MTGNN and GWN and StemGNN increases as
            the window size is increased, as MTGNN does not demonstrate similar
            levels of performance degradation. Further, the results demonstrate
            that predictive performance of the GNN and baseline models decreases
            as the window size is increased.

            We tested the performance of ST-GNNs and baseline LSTM on a
            multi-step forecasting task for 20-, 40- and 60-day window sizes and
            5-, 10- and 20-day prediction horizons.
          </p>

          <p>
            Comparing MAPE, <b>GWN</b> significantly outperforms MTGNN, StemGNN
            and the LSTM for the tested hyperparameters. Whilst the LSTM obtains
            consistently lower RMSE scores, this can be attributed to the
            independently-generated model predictions, which potentially reduces
            error propagation.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            MTGNN is the unexpected laggard for the evaluated multi-step
            forecasting tasks, demonstrating inferior performance relative to
            the baseline. However, the LSTM is incapable of multi-node
            forecasting and is independantly trained.
          </p>

          <p>
            The results show a general decline in predictive performance as the
            horizon length is increased. There is no clear relation between
            window size and prediction error.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our results demonstrate that an ST-GNN can produce suitable accuracy
            on the price prediction problem. For both tasks, a ST-GNN achieves a
            considerable performance improvement over the baseline LSTM. This
            supports modelling both temporal and latent spatial dependencies in
            stock market data.

            We tested the performance of GWN and MTGNN on a multi-step
            forecasting task for 20- and 40- window sizes, 5- and 10-day
            horizons with the inclusion of the correlation matrix to initialise
            the GWN and MTGNN adjacency matrices.
          </p>
          <p>
            The results demonstrate that the provision of structural information
            proxied by a correlation matrix does not improve predictive
            performance. For GWN, the forward-backward-adaptive adjacency matrix
            configuration marginally outperforms for a 20-day input window only.
          </p>

          <p>
            The provision of prior information results in a minimal improvement
            in MTGNN's predictive performance for a 20-day window. However,
            performance similarly degrades as the window size is doubled.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our results show that a correlation matrix is a sub-optimal
            mechanism encode prior structural information. The prior inclusion
            of multivariate correlations produced a negligible impact on
            predictive accuracy. We conclude that linear correlations do not
            capture complex latent dependencies in the stock market.

            GWN extract a graph structure that is highly dissimilar to that
            represented by the correlation matrix. <br />Comparing the adaptive
            adjacency matrices, GWN extracts a sparse graphical structure, in
            contrast to the dense graph learnt by MTGNN. <br />There are no
            identifiable commonalities between the two matrices, nor is one
            matrix a more fine-grained dependency representation.

            GWN's share price forecasting performance suggests that the model
            can accurately extract spatial dependencies. Therefore, we can infer
            that fewer complex dependencies exist, given that the sparse graph
            is an approximate representation of market structure.
          </p>

          <p>
            We constructed a simple and two-level hierarchical correlation
            network from the static correlation matrix. Our analysis identified
            that the network communities stabilises at two. This aligns with the
            results of bi-clustering performed on the correlation matrix, which
            finds two compact clusters of highly correlated stocks. Further
            analysis can produce structural information encodings that may
            capture non-linear dependencies more effectively.

            This research has addressed gaps in the literature and produced
            empirical results that assess the applicability of the selected
            ST-GNNs to JSE-listed share price prediction and the suitability of
            a correlation matrix proxy for the graph structure.<br />
            <br />
            We produced a state-of-the-art representation of the dependencies in
            the FTSE/JSE Top 40 Index through the GWN adaptive graph. We provide
            a foundation for future investigation of spatial-temporal graph
            neural networks and real-world applications of stock market
            prediction. Future research can evaluate stock market data from
